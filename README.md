## Clone the repository, start brainstorming your ideas! ðŸ’¡

Follow the below commands step by step, to clone this repository in your machine and get the website in the same state as I was during the meet.

* Cloning the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Soumyajit0803/devbeats.git
    ```
* Move to project working directory
    ```bash
    cd devbeats
    ```
* Install required dependencies
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

And it is done! Now run the vite server using the following command and check if the website is live on you local machine.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Start building from here, we are excited to see your ideas!âœ¨
