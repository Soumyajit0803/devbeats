## Clone the repository, start brainstorming your ideas! 💡

Follow the below commands step by step, to clone this repository in your machine and get the website in the same state as I was during the meet.

* Cloning the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Soumyajit0803/devbeats.git
    ```
* Move to project working directory
    ```bash
    cd devbeats
    ```
* Install required dependencies
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

And it is done! Now run the vite server using the following command and check if the website is live on you local machine.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Start building from here, we are excited to see your ideas!✨
